Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The code starts by importing the necessary libraries. We import `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` to handle the plotting of the line.

2. The `dda_algorithm` function takes four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, representing the coordinates of the starting and ending points of the line.

3. Inside the `dda_algorithm` function, the differences between the x and y coordinates (`dx` and `dy`) are calculated using the provided formula: `dx = x2 - x1` and `dy = y2 - y1`.

4. The number of steps required for rasterization is determined by taking the absolute value of either `dx` or `dy`, whichever is greater. This is done using the conditional expression: `steps = abs(dx) if abs(dx) > abs(dy) else abs(dy)`.

5. Increment values for each step are calculated by dividing `dx` and `dy` by the number of steps: `x_increment = dx / steps` and `y_increment = dy / steps`.

6. Starting coordinates `x` and `y` are initialized with the values of `x1` and `y1`.

7. Empty lists `x_values` and `y_values` are created to store the calculated coordinates.

8. A loop iterates `steps + 1` times. In each iteration, the current coordinates `x` and `y` are rounded and appended to the `x_values` and `y_values` lists. Then, `x` is incremented by `x_increment` and `y` is incremented by `y_increment`.

9. Finally, the function returns the lists `x_values` and `y_values` containing the calculated coordinates of the line.

10. After defining the `dda_algorithm` function, the code prompts the user to enter the coordinates `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` for the line using the `input` function. The `float` function is used to convert the user input into floating-point numbers.

11. The `dda_algorithm` function is called with the provided coordinates, and the returned `x_values` and `y_values` lists are assigned to the corresponding variables.

12. The line is plotted using `plt.plot(x_values, y_values, marker='o')`, where `x_values` and `y_values` represent the x and y coordinates of the line. The `marker='o'` argument specifies that circular markers should be placed at the coordinates.

13. The rest of the code handles labeling the x and y axes, setting the title of the plot, and displaying the grid.

14. Finally, `plt.show()` is called to display the plot with the line.

By running this code and providing the coordinates, you will see a plot showing the line rasterization using the DDA algorithm based on the given inputs.
